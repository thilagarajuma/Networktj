In **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**, communication between different areas (like **Area 10** and **Area 20**) happens through the **Backbone Area (Area 0)** using a special type of router called an **ABR (Area Border Router)**. This is done using specific **LSAs (Link-State Advertisements)**.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ How Area 10 Communicates with Area 20**
1. **OSPF is a hierarchical protocol**, meaning:
   - **All areas must connect to Area 0 (Backbone Area).**
   - If Area 10 and Area 20 exist, both must connect to **Area 0** via an **ABR**.
   - Direct communication between non-backbone areas (Area 10 to Area 20) **is not possible without Area 0**.

2. **ABR (Area Border Router) Role**
   - An **ABR** is a router that connects two or more OSPF areas.
   - It acts as a **gateway** between **Area 10** and **Area 20** by redistributing routes from one area to another via **Area 0**.

## **ðŸ”¹ LSAs Used for Inter-Area Communication**
OSPF uses **different types of LSAs** to share routing information across areas.

| **LSA Type** | **Description** | **Generated By** | **Purpose** |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|------------|
| **LSA Type 1** | Router LSA | Every Router | Lists links within the same area |
| **LSA Type 2** | Network LSA | DR (Designated Router) | Describes networks in multi-access links |
| **LSA Type 3** | **Summary LSA** | **ABR** | Used to share **inter-area routes** (Area 10 â†” Area 20) |
| **LSA Type 4** | ASBR Summary LSA | ABR | Provides reachability to an ASBR (for external routes) |
| **LSA Type 5** | External LSA | ASBR | Advertises external routes (from another routing protocol like BGP) |
| **LSA Type 7** | NSSA LSA | ASBR (in NSSA) | Used in NSSA (Not-So-Stubby Areas) |

ðŸ‘‰ **Inter-Area Routing Uses LSA Type 3 (Summary LSA)**  
- The **ABR creates Type 3 LSAs** to advertise networks from **Area 10 into Area 0**.  
- Then, another ABR forwards these **Type 3 LSAs** into **Area 20**.  
- This way, routers in Area 10 learn about Area 20, and vice versa.

---

## **ðŸ”¹ Example Scenario**
Let's assume:
- **R1** (ABR) connects **Area 10** and **Area 0**.
- **R2** (ABR) connects **Area 20** and **Area 0**.
- OSPF is running on all routers.

### **How Routing Happens:**
1. **A router in Area 10 advertises a network (e.g., 10.10.10.0/24)** as a **Type 1 LSA**.
2. **ABR (R1) converts it into a Type 3 LSA** and floods it into **Area 0**.
3. **Another ABR (R2) forwards the Type 3 LSA into Area 20**.
4. **Routers in Area 20 learn about the 10.10.10.0/24 network** and can route traffic accordingly.

## **ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways**
âœ… **Communication between areas happens via Area 0.**  
âœ… **ABRs generate Type 3 LSAs (Summary LSAs) to share routes across areas.**  
âœ… **If Area 10 and Area 20 are not connected to Area 0, OSPF will not work unless a Virtual Link is configured.**
