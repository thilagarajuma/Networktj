### **Difference Between Active and Passive FTP**  

📌 **Overview:**  
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) uses **two channels**:  
1️⃣ **Control Channel** (for commands and responses)  
2️⃣ **Data Channel** (for actual file transfers)  

The key difference between **Active** and **Passive** FTP is **how the data connection is established** between the client and the server.  

---

### **1️⃣ Active FTP (Default Mode)**
- **Client initiates** the control connection to the server on **port 21**.  
- **Server initiates** the data connection **from port 20** to the **client’s random high port**.  
- **Issue:** If the client is behind a firewall/NAT, the connection may be blocked because the server is trying to initiate a connection to the client.  

✅ **Best for:** Public servers with **no NAT/firewall restrictions**.  

📌 **Example Connection Flow (Active FTP)**  
1️⃣ Client → Server: **Connects to TCP port 21** (Control Channel).  
2️⃣ Client → Server: **Sends PORT command** (Tells server where to connect for data).  
3️⃣ Server → Client: **Initiates data connection from port 20** to the client's specified port.  
4️⃣ Data transfer begins.  

---

### **2️⃣ Passive FTP (Firewall/NAT-Friendly)**
- **Client initiates** both the **control** and **data connections** to the server.  
- **Server does NOT initiate** any connections back to the client.  
- The server tells the client which port it should connect to for data transfer using a **PASV command**.  

✅ **Best for:** Clients behind **firewalls and NAT** (e.g., corporate networks, home users).  

📌 **Example Connection Flow (Passive FTP)**  
1️⃣ Client → Server: **Connects to TCP port 21** (Control Channel).  
2️⃣ Client → Server: **Sends PASV command** (Requests a passive data connection).  
3️⃣ Server → Client: **Responds with a random high port**.  
4️⃣ Client → Server: **Initiates data connection to the specified port**.  
5️⃣ Data transfer begins.

### **🔥 Key Differences Between Active & Passive FTP**
| Feature            | Active FTP                          | Passive FTP                        |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Data Connection** | Server → Client (from port 20) | Client → Server (random high port) |
| **Firewall-Friendly?** | ❌ No, often blocked by NAT/firewalls | ✅ Yes, works with NAT/firewalls |
| **Control Channel** | Always client to server (port 21) | Always client to server (port 21) |
| **Security Risk?** | Higher (Server initiates connection) | Lower (Client initiates connection) |
| **Used In?** | Public servers with open networks | Corporate & home networks with firewalls |

### **💡 When to Use Active vs. Passive FTP?**
✔️ **Use Active FTP** if **both** client and server can accept incoming connections.  
✔️ **Use Passive FTP** if **client is behind NAT/firewall** (Most common today).
