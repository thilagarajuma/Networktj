In the scenario where **Switch A** and **Switch B** are connected via a trunk link but have a **Native VLAN mismatch** (Switch A has Native VLAN 1, and Switch B has Native VLAN 11), the behavior of **VLAN 10, 20, and 30 traffic** depends on whether the traffic is **tagged** or **untagged**. Here's a detailed explanation:

---

### **Behavior of VLAN 10, 20, and 30 Traffic**
1. **Tagged Traffic (VLAN 10, 20, 30)**:
   - Traffic for VLANs 10, 20, and 30 is sent with an **802.1Q tag** on the trunk link.
   - Since tagged traffic is explicitly labeled with the VLAN ID, it is **not affected by the Native VLAN mismatch**.
   - Devices in VLAN 10, 20, and 30 on Switch A will be able to communicate with devices in the same VLANs on Switch B, as long as:
     - The VLANs are allowed on the trunk link (`switchport trunk allowed vlan`).
     - The VLANs exist on both switches.

2. **Untagged Traffic (Native VLAN)**:
   - Untagged traffic is affected by the Native VLAN mismatch.
   - Switch A sends untagged traffic for Native VLAN 1, but Switch B interprets it as belonging to Native VLAN 11.
   - As a result:
     - Devices in VLAN 1 on Switch A will not be able to communicate with devices in VLAN 1 on Switch B.
     - Devices in VLAN 11 on Switch B will not be able to communicate with devices in VLAN 11 on Switch A (if VLAN 11 exists on Switch A).

### **Key Points for VLAN 10, 20, and 30 Traffic**
- **Tagged Traffic**:
  - VLAN 10, 20, and 30 traffic is **tagged** and will **work correctly** across the trunk link, even with a Native VLAN mismatch.
  - The mismatch only affects **untagged traffic** (Native VLAN).

- **Untagged Traffic**:
  - If any device connected to the trunk link sends untagged traffic (e.g., a device configured for the Native VLAN), it will be misassigned to the wrong VLAN due to the mismatch.
  - For example:
    - A device in VLAN 1 on Switch A sends untagged traffic, which Switch B misassigns to VLAN 11.
    - A device in VLAN 11 on Switch B sends untagged traffic, which Switch A misassigns to VLAN 1.

### **Impact on Network Communication**
1. **VLAN 10, 20, and 30**:
   - Communication between devices in these VLANs will **work normally** because the traffic is tagged and not affected by the Native VLAN mismatch.

2. **Native VLAN (VLAN 1 and VLAN 11)**:
   - Communication between devices in the Native VLANs will **fail** due to the mismatch.
   - Devices in VLAN 1 on Switch A will not be able to communicate with devices in VLAN 1 on Switch B.
   - Devices in VLAN 11 on Switch B will not be able to communicate with devices in VLAN 11 on Switch A.

3. **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)**:
   - STP BPDUs are sent untagged and belong to the Native VLAN.
   - A mismatch in the Native VLAN can cause STP to fail, potentially leading to network loops or instability.

### **How to Fix the Issue**
1. **Ensure Consistent Native VLAN Configuration**:
   - Configure the same Native VLAN on both ends of the trunk link.
   - Example configuration on Switch A:
     ```bash
     interface GigabitEthernet0/1
      switchport mode trunk
      switchport trunk native vlan 11
     ```

2. **Avoid Using VLAN 1**:
   - For security reasons, avoid using VLAN 1 as the Native VLAN. Instead, use an unused VLAN ID (e.g., VLAN 11 in this case).

3. **Verify VLAN Configuration**:
   - Ensure that VLANs 10, 20, and 30 are allowed on the trunk link on both switches.
   Example:
   ```bash
   interface GigabitEthernet0/1
    switchport mode trunk
    switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30
   ```

4. **Test Connectivity**:
   - After fixing the mismatch, test connectivity between devices in the same VLAN across the trunk link.

---

### **Summary**
- **VLAN 10, 20, and 30 traffic** will **work correctly** because it is tagged and not affected by the Native VLAN mismatch.
- **Native VLAN traffic** (VLAN 1 and VLAN 11) will **fail** due to the mismatch.
- To resolve the issue, ensure the **Native VLAN is consistent** on both ends of the trunk link and avoid using VLAN 1 for security reasons.

By fixing the Native VLAN mismatch, you can ensure proper communication for all VLANs and maintain a stable and secure network.
