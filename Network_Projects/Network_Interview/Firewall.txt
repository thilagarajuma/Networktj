### **Types of Firewall Architectures**  

Firewalls can be deployed in different **architectural models** based on security requirements, scalability, and redundancy. Here are the **main firewall architectures** used in enterprise networks:  

---

## **1️⃣ Single-Tier Architecture (Flat Network)**  
- A basic setup where a **single firewall** sits between the internal network and the internet.  
- Used in **small offices** or **branch networks**.  
- No segmentation; all traffic goes through a single firewall.  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔️ Simple and easy to manage.  
✔️ Low cost.  

❌ **Cons:**  
❌ No internal segmentation → If breached, the entire network is exposed.  
❌ Not scalable for large networks.  

✅ **Example Deployment:**  
🔹 A single **Check Point, Palo Alto, or Cisco ASA** firewall protecting a small office.  

---

## **2️⃣ Two-Tier Architecture (DMZ-Based)**  
- Uses **two firewalls** or **firewall zones** to separate public, private, and DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) networks.  
- Public-facing services (e.g., web servers, mail servers) are placed in the **DMZ**.  
- Internal traffic stays protected behind a second firewall.  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔️ Better security with **internal network isolation**.  
✔️ Protects public-facing services separately.  

❌ **Cons:**  
❌ Slightly more complex than single-tier.  
❌ More expensive due to additional firewall requirements.  

✅ **Example Deployment:**  
🔹 **Check Point Security Gateway + SMS** managing **DMZ & Internal zones**.  
🔹 **Palo Alto Zones** → External, DMZ, and Trust networks.

## **3️⃣ Three-Tier Architecture (Enterprise Model)**  
- Separates security into three layers:  
  1️⃣ **Perimeter Firewall** – Protects the external edge (internet).  
  2️⃣ **DMZ Firewall** – Secures public services like web and mail servers.  
  3️⃣ **Internal Firewall** – Protects sensitive internal networks (databases, corporate LANs).  
- Used in **large enterprises, data centers, and cloud environments**.  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔️ **Maximum security** with multi-layer protection.  
✔️ Prevents **lateral movement** in case of a breach.  
✔️ **Scalable** for large networks.  

❌ **Cons:**  
❌ Complex to manage.  
❌ Higher hardware and licensing costs.  

✅ **Example Deployment:**  
🔹 **Check Point:** 3-tier **Security Gateways** managed by a **SmartCenter Server**.  
🔹 **Palo Alto:** Perimeter PA-5250, DMZ PA-3220, Internal PA-220 managed via **Panorama**.  

---

## **4️⃣ Distributed Firewall Architecture (Zero Trust)**  
- Firewalls are deployed **at every key point** in the network (perimeter, branch offices, cloud).  
- Uses **micro-segmentation** to protect workloads.  
- Common in **cloud-native and SD-WAN deployments**.  

✅ **Pros:**  
✔️ **Granular security** at every level.  
✔️ **Better cloud & remote access protection**.  
✔️ Ideal for **hybrid cloud & multi-cloud** environments.  

❌ **Cons:**  
❌ High complexity & operational overhead.  
❌ Requires **centralized management (e.g., Panorama, SmartConsole, FortiManager)**.  

✅ **Example Deployment:**  
🔹 **Check Point CloudGuard + On-Prem Gateways**.  
🔹 **Palo Alto Prisma Access + Physical Firewalls**.

## **🔥 Which Architecture Should You Use?**  
- **Small business?** → **Single-Tier** (One Firewall).  
- **Enterprise with public-facing servers?** → **Two-Tier (DMZ-Based)**.  
- **Large corporate networks & data centers?** → **Three-Tier (Perimeter, DMZ, Internal)**.  
- **Cloud & SD-WAN environments?** → **Distributed Firewall (Zero Trust Model)**.
