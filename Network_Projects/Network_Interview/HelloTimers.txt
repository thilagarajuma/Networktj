Here's the list of routing protocol timers in text format without tables:

---

### **1. Distance Vector Protocol Timers (RIP, EIGRP)**

- **Update Timer**: The time interval between periodic routing updates.  
  - **RIP**: 30 sec

- **Invalid Timer**: The time before a route is declared invalid if no updates are received.  
  - **RIP**: 180 sec  
  - **EIGRP**: 3 × Hello Timer

- **Hold-Down Timer**: The time to suppress updates for an unreachable route to avoid flapping.  
  - **RIP**: 180 sec  
  - **EIGRP**: 3 × Hello Timer

- **Flush Timer**: The time before removing an invalid route from the routing table.  
  - **RIP**: 240 sec  
  - **EIGRP**: 3 × Hold Timer

- **Hello Timer**: The time between Hello packets for neighbor discovery.  
  - **EIGRP**: 5 sec (LAN) / 60 sec (WAN)

### **2. Link-State Protocol Timers (OSPF, IS-IS)**

- **Hello Timer**: The time interval between Hello packets for neighbor discovery.  
  - **OSPF**: 10 sec (Broadcast) / 30 sec (NBMA)  
  - **IS-IS**: 10 sec

- **Dead Timer**: The time before declaring a neighbor dead if no Hello packets are received.  
  - **OSPF**: 40 sec (Broadcast) / 120 sec (NBMA)  
  - **IS-IS**: 30 sec

- **LSA (Link-State Advertisement) Refresh Timer**: The time to refresh LSAs in the Link-State Database (LSDB).  
  - **OSPF**: 30 minutes

- **LSA Hold Timer**: The delay between flooding the same LSA to prevent redundant transmissions.  
  - **OSPF**: 5 sec

- **SPF Calculation Delay Timer**: The time delay before running the SPF algorithm again after a topology change.  
  - **OSPF**: 5 sec

### **3. Path Vector Protocol Timers (BGP)**

- **Keepalive Timer**: The time interval between keepalive messages to maintain the BGP neighbor connection.  
  - **Default**: 60 sec

- **Hold Timer**: The time before declaring a BGP neighbor down if no keepalive message is received.  
  - **Default**: 180 sec (3 × Keepalive Timer)

- **Route Advertisement Interval**: The minimum time before advertising the same route again.  
  - **iBGP**: 5 sec  
  - **eBGP**: 30 sec

- **Route Flap Dampening Timer**: The time to suppress unstable routes to avoid route flapping.  
  - **Default**: Half-life = 15 minutes, Max suppression = 60 minutes
